The application offers features such as listing and filtering dishes and orders, and relies on a relational SQL database.

## Technologies Used

- **Visual Paradigm** for modeling the system, including use case diagrams, class diagrams, sequence diagrams, and navigation.
- **SQL** as the relational database management system to store information about dishes and orders.
- **Java** as the main programming language for developing the mobile application.
- **Android Studio** as the development platform to ensure compatibility with Android devices.

## Key Features

- **Creation, modification, and deletion of dishes** with details such as name, description, category, and price.
- **Order management** including customer name, phone number, pickup date and time, and dish selection.
- **Listing and filtering dishes and orders** by criteria such as status, customer name, mobile number, or pickup date and time.

## System Design

- The design includes use case diagrams, class diagrams, sequence diagrams, and navigation diagrams to facilitate understanding and operation of the application.
- Screen prototypes and navigation maps help visualize the application's flow and user interactions.
